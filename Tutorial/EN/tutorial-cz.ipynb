    "Theoretically, the controlled-Z gate (CZ gate) is a two-qubit quantum gate that adds a phase of $e^{i\\pi}$ to the target qubit if the control qubit and target qubit's state is $|11\\rangle$. The physical implementation of the CZ gate is realized using magnetic flux to tune the qubit's eigenfrequency - this is accomplished by slowly increasing the magnetic flux, waiting for some time to add a phase $\\pi$ and then decreasing the flux back to 0 \\[1\\]. CZ gate allows for faster two-qubit control than the cross-resonance gate due to stronger inductive coupling. \n",
