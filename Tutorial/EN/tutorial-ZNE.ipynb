    "## ZNE: Theory\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) is a powerful technique for mitigating quantum errors in quantum computing. Notice that ZNE does not directly reduce the inherent noise in the quantum computing process, but instead infers the ideal computation result by repeating the same quantum computing process many times with different levels of noise \\[1, 2\\]. The advantage of ZNE is that we do not need to know the exact form of the noise as well as how to control the noise source.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation process of this method is shown in the figure below. The figure shows that the ZNE method is composed of two steps: rescaling noise and extrapolating. Among various noise rescaling techniques, time-variant rescaling is a robust and promising one. This technique stretches the system Hamiltonian in time domain according to some rescaling coefficient to obtain an equivalently noise-rescaled final quantum state. For simplicity, we use the Richardson extrapolation in our Quanlse implementation, a mature numeric algorithm that can eliminate error of any order in principle. We remark that there are many other extrapolation methods such as polynomial and exponential extrapolation methods \\[3\\].\n",

    "### Noise rescaling\n",
    "\n",
    "On the physical level, a quantum computing process with noise can be described by the Lindblad master equation:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\rho(t) = -i[K,\\rho]+\\lambda\\mathcal{L}(\\rho),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for time $t\\in[0,T]$. In this formulation, the Hamiltonian $K$ (which might be time-dependent) represents the ideal coherent evolution we aim to implement, while the Lindblad operator $\\mathcal{L}$ represents the noisy process we hope to mitigate. We emphasize that there is no need to know the exact form of the generator $\\mathcal{L}$. We only require that it is *time-invariant* and its effect is dominated by a scalar noise parameter $\\lambda$. Let $\\rho_\\lambda(T)$ be the final state after evolution time $T$. Given a positive coefficient $c$, can we obtain a noise-rescaled final state $\\rho_{c\\lambda}(T)$? Surprisingly, this is possible whenever the Lindblad operator is time-invariant. Consider the following procedure. We implement a time-stretching and amplitude-contracting version of the system Hamiltonian via:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K(t)\\to K'(t) = \\frac{K(t/c)}{c}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "What's more, we stretch the system evolution time to $cT$. It has been proven that this rescaled Hamiltonian $K'(t)$ will lead to a new evaluation whose final state is exactly $\\rho_{c\\lambda}(T)$ numerically \\[1\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimentally, stretching the evolution time ($T\\to cT$) is easy to implement. Now let's analyze how to obtain the rescaled Hamiltonian $K'(t)$. In general, the systematic Hamiltonian is composed of time-independent drift items and time-dependent control ones, and the latter act on quantum states in the form of driving pulses. As an example, we learn from the [Single-Qubit Gate Tutorial](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/tutorial-single-qubit) in Quanlse that the driving pulses of the Hadamard gate\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "1&1\\\\\n",
    "1&-1\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "are optimized as one $X$-channel pulse and one $Y$-channel pulse. As so, to implement the rescaled Hamiltonian is to stretch the corresponding driving pulses. In the following, we show by case the rescaled driving pulses of the optimized Hadamard gate with rescaling coefficients $1$ (does not rescale), $1.25$, and $1.5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![zne-profile](figures/zne-pulse-rescale-h.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To close this section, we comment that the noise parameter $\\lambda$ might also be other physical-relevant quantities, such as infidelity, temperature, error probability, variational parameter, etc. For example, we implement this ZNE method in Quanlse by treating the infidelity of the quantum circuit as the noise parameter $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "In numeric analysis, Richardson extrapolation is an efficient numerical method commonly used to eliminate low-order estimation errors. This method assumes that the estimated value $E(\\lambda)$ could be expressed as a power series of $\\lambda$ with respect to the ideal value $E^{\\ast}\\equiv E(\\lambda=0)$: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "E(\\lambda) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d} a_k\\lambda^k + O(\\lambda^{d+1}),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $E^{\\ast} = a_0$, $\\{a_k\\}$ is a set of coefficients to be determined, and $d$ is the order we aim to extrapolate. If we can obtain a set of estimators $\\left\\{E(\\lambda_j)\\right\\}_{j=1}^{d+1}$ with different parameters, we can construct a new estimator $E^d(\\lambda)$ from this set. In comparison with the original noisy estimator $E(\\lambda)$, this new estimator has a higher-precision estimation error (to $d$-order) \\[4\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "![extrapolation](figures/zne-extrapolation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above figure, we demonstrate the Richardson extrapolation by setting $d=2$. From the figure, we can see that the data points are linearly fitted, and the ideal value $E^{\\ast}$ can be inferred via extrapolation. It is worth noting that the Richardson extrapolation is just one of many extrapolation methods. It works well only when the power series assumption is valid. Luckily, this assumption holds naturally within the above Lindblad master equation framework, as justified in \\[1\\]."

Then, for this circuit, we calculate the expectation value with the input state being $|0\\rangle$ and the quantum observable being $A$.
