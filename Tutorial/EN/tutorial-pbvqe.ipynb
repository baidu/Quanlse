    "Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a popular quantum algorithm for approximating the ground state energy of molecules on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. VQE is mainly used to estimate the minimum eigenvalue of a given Hamiltonian and find its ground state. For near-term quantum computers, critical gate errors, decoherence, and poor connectivity limit the depth of quantum circuits. However, the VQE algorithm can work with low-depth quantum circuits. Hence, the VQE algorithm is considered an ideal candidate to utilize NISQ devices to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In VQE, the essential task is to calculate the ground state energy of a given discretized molecular Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{\\rm mole}$ by a parametrized trail state $|\\psi(\\vec{\\theta})\\rangle$. The trail state $|\\psi(\\vec{\\theta})\\rangle$ is generated by a parameterized ansatz. At the same time, we employ the classical optimization methods to find a set of optimal $\\vec{\\theta}$ to minimize the expectation value $E = \\langle \\psi(\\vec{\\theta}) | \\hat{H}_{\\rm mole} | \\psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle$, which represents the approximate ground state energy $E_0$ of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}_{\\rm mole}$:\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the method to implement VQE for solving the ground state energy of a hydrogen molecule $H_2$. We simulate the VQE on a superconducting system at the pulse level while considering multiple nonideal factors. The following figure shows a common ansatz for generating trail states:\n",

However, we use the superconducting hardware-efficient two-qubit gates, i.e., cross-resonance (CR) gates, which also can realize maximal entanglements using single-qubit gates. Thus, the above four-qubit circuit is formed by single-qubit gates and CR gates. The matrix of an ideal CR gate is:\n",

    "In this tutorial, we study the VQE algorithm at the pulse level, which we call **pulse-based VQE**. Unlike the classical VQE which optimizes the rotation parameters of the single-qubit gates from the logical quantum circuit, pulse-based VQE directly takes the pulse parameters as the optimization parameters to find the minimal loss value (i.e. ground state energy). The following figure shows the difference between the pulse-based VQE and the standard VQE:\n",
    "\n",
    "![VQE](figures/vqe-scheme.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement pulse-based VQE, we need to translate the logical quantum circuit into a **pulse-based quantum circuit**, i.e., the logical rotating gates $R_x(\\theta)$ and $R_y(\\theta)$ are replaced by the corresponding control pulses on $X$ and $Y$ channels respectively with variable amplitudes - which we call **pulse-based gates**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![VQE](figures/vqe-translate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this figure, $U_{\\rm ENT}$ is a unitary matrix which can create the required entanglement - the details will be explained in the following sections. Here, we use a new notation representing the parameters of **pulse-based gates**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\vec{A} = [A_0, \\cdots, A_m, \\cdots, A_{M-1}],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $M$ is the total number of **pulse-based gates**; $A_m$ denotes the amplitude of the Gaussian waveform of the $m$-th **pulse-based gate**:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Omega_m(t) = A_m e^{-(\\frac{t - \\tau_m}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma_m}) ^2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Other pulse parameters such as the width $\\sigma_m$ and the central position $\\tau_m$ will be fixed throughout the procedure. Based on the introduction of **pulse-based VQE**, we no longer need to generate an optimized drive pulse according to the parameters from the logical quantum circuit. This improves the efficiency of VQE and the accuracy of the results significantly.\n",
