    "Simulating time evolution of the qubits at the pulse level gives us more insight into the physics of quantum gates and the effects of noise. For superconducting quantum circuits, the transmon qubits are controlled by applying microwave pulses and magnetic flux. However, the performance of quantum gates is often suppressed by various factors: the decoherence of the qubit due to its interaction with the environment, the unwanted crosstalk effect, and leakage into the higher levels of the transmon. \n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-qubit noisy simulator provided by Quanlse allows us to simulate quantum operations on a noisy quantum device consisting of multiple transmon qubits to understand the physics behind quantum computing better. Several main types of noise are included in our noisy simulator: decoherence noise, amplitude noise, and crosstalk noise. We will focus on several common applications in superconducting quantum computing based on this noisy simulator: Rabi oscillation, Cross-Resonance effect, and characterizing ZZ crosstalk through a Ramsey experiment."
