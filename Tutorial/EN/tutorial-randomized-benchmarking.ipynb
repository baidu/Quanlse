    "There are generally two ways in experiments for characterizing the performance of a quantum computer in a superconducting platform: Quantum Process Tomography(QPT) and Randomized Benchmarking(RB) \\[1\\]. QPT can completely characterize a gate, decomposing a process into Pauli or Kraus operators, but improving gates by QPT is complicated and resource-consuming. Also, State Preparation And Measurement (SPAM) errors can be confused with process errors. However, RB is a concept of using randomization methods for benchmarking quantum gates. It is a scalable and SPAM robust method for benchmarking the full set of gates by a single parameter using randomization techniques. So it is useful to use RB for a relatively simple and at least SPAM-robust benchmark, especially when the number of qubit increases.\n",

    "**Basic RB**\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually use pure Clifford gates to get a sequence fidelity decay curve by randomly choose $m$ Clifford gates followed by an inverse Clifford gate to make sure that the effect of all $m+1$ Clifford gates is an identity operation $\\mathcal{I}$ and then apply them to a qubit:\n",
    "\n",
    "![basicRB](figures/basicRB.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The above circuit shows how our basic randomized benchmarking works. $C_{i}$ represents the $i_{th} (i = 1, 2, 3, \\dots, m)$ Clifford gates we randomly choose. Ideally, assume our qubit's initial state is $|\\psi\\rangle$, and there is no noise in this RB procedure, we will get the final state being $|\\psi\\rangle$ for $100\\%$ probability, and we use the probability of the final state still being $|\\psi\\rangle$ as a measure of our RB sequence fidelity \\[2\\]. However, in reality, this sequence fidelity $\\mathcal{F}$ decays when the number of gates increases because of the accumulation of noise. If the noise distribution is time- and gate-independent, such decay can be described by a zeroth fitting function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}^{(0)}=Ap_{\\rm basic}^m+B,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m$ is the number of Cliffords we apply. For more detailed basic knowledge and related theories about randomized benchmarking, users can refer to \\[3\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of RB is that the SPAM error is included in the parameters $A$ and $B$ without affecting the rate of decay parameter $p$. More specifically, if we decompose the initial density operator $\\rho$ and measurement operator $\\hat{E}$ into Pauli basis $\\hat{P}_i$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho=\\sum_jx_j\\hat{P}_i/d,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{E}=\\sum_j\\tilde{e}_j\\hat{P}_j,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then $A = \\sum_{j\\neq 0}\\tilde{e}_jx_j$, and $B = \\tilde{e}_0$ where $d\\equiv{2^n}$ and $n$ is the number of qubits. Once we successfully get $p_{basic}$ by fitting the curve, we can obtain the average EPC(Error-rate Per Clifford) immediately:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\rm EPC}=\\frac{(1-p_{\\rm basic})(d-1)}{d}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interleaved RB**\n",
    "\n",
    "Interleaved randomized benchmarking is used to get the average error rate of a particular quantum gate. After we obtained a reference sequence fidelity decay curve by first implementing the basic RB, we can then apply the so-called interleaved randomized benchmarking \\[2\\] to benchmark the performance of the Hadamard gate. We interleaved our aimed gate behind every time we implement a random Clifford gate and then make the gate sequence equals to the identity gate by an inverse Clifford gate. The interleaved randomized benchmarking sequence shown below takes the Hadamard gate(H gate) being the target gate as an example: :\n",
    "\n",
    "![interleavedRB](figures/interleavedRB.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can as well get a sequence fidelity decay curve that is similarily described by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}^{(0)\\prime}=A^{\\prime}p_{\\rm gate}^m+B^{\\prime}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we calculate the average error rate on the aimed gate EPG(Error-rate Per Gate) by subtracting the reference curve away:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{\\rm gate}=\\frac{(1-p_{\\rm gate}/p_{\\rm ref})(d-1)}{d}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, this gate error $r$ characterizes the gate's performance we want to benchmark since it is derived from a set of experiments' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will use Quanlse to implement the RB experiment to benchmark a Hadamard gate. As mentioned above, since we are going to benchmark a specific gate, we need to use both basic RB and interleaved RB. It is worth mentioning that in the up-to-date version of Quanlse, we only support the single-qubit Randomized Benchmarking with Clifford basis. "
