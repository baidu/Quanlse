    "When a target quantum gate is implemented using control pulses, the actual quantum operation might differ from the target operation. This difference is normally quantified as infidelity. Understanding the sources of errors that lead to this infidelity is important for us to design pulse sequences that can mitigate these errors and improve gate fidelity. \n",
